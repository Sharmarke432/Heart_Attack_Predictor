Heart Attack Predictor

A machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on user health data. Built with Python, leveraging pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and joblib. The app is deployed as an interactive web interface using Streamlit.

Features
- Predict heart attack risk using clinical features.

- Data manipulation and analysis with pandas and numpy.

- Model training and prediction with scikit-learn.

- Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

- Model saving/loading with joblib.

- Interactive UI built and deployed with Streamlit.

Dependencies
The project depends on the following Python libraries:

- Library	Purpose
- pandas	Data manipulation
- numpy	Numerical operations
- scikit-learn	Machine learning algorithms
- matplotlib	Data visualization
- seaborn	Statistical data visualization
- joblib	Model serialization
